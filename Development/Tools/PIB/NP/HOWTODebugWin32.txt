1. set MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=c:\sdk\sample\Debug
2. Copy xpt file to output directory
3. Run mozilla.exe -console
4. In TaskManager, under the Proccess tab, right click on mozilla.exe and choose Debug. 
You can also attach to process or pre-load DLLS in Visual Studio's IDE.

Don't forget to set pref("plugin.dont_try_safe_calls", true); 
so the browser won't catch crashes. See ..\readme.txt

Additional notes:
set NSPR_LOG_MODOULES=Plugin:8,PluginNPP:8,PluginNPN:8 to see debug info in console
You can also set NSPR_LOG_FILE= to go to a file instead.
