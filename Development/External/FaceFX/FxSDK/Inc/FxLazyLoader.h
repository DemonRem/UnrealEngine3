/// Provides lazy-loading for objects contained in archives.
/// Using a lazy loader is slightly involved.  For one, note the const modifier
/// on the Load() function.  Any class you wish to be lazy-loaded 
/// should be derived from FxLazyLoader and should implement Load() and
/// Unload() (it is up to you if you want Unload() to actually do anything).
/// Don't forget to implement FxLazyLoader portions in your copy constructors
/// and assignment operators (adding the lazy loader to the archive as well).
///
/// You should call Load() first in any function that actually uses
/// the data contained in the lazy-loaded object.  FxLazyLoaders act as "ghost"
/// objects in this sense.  See FxAnimUserData.cpp in the FaceFX Studio source
/// code for an example and details of the serialization.
///
/// Another point to be aware of is that currently you should not create a
/// lazy-loaded object that contains a pointer to some other serialized object.
/// Due to the way pointer serialization works, this could lead to the real
/// pointed-to object being skipped over during serialization and some other
/// object actually loading that references the same pointed-to object, causing
/// the other object to try to load the pointed-to object "in-place" in the 
/// archive, which will hose everything.
