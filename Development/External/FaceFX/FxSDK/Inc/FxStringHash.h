/// In that case the insertion of the second object will fail because there 
/// is already an object with its key in the hash.  Make note of this when using
/// FxStringHash as it is assumed that each key / object pair in the hash is 
/// unique and does not compare the actual objects when searching (only the keys 
/// themselves are compared).

/// HashedObjectType is the type of object to be hashed by string.
///
/// HashBinContainerType is the type of container used in each hash bin.  This
/// defaults to FxArray, but can be set to any FaceFX container class type
/// (e.g. FxList is also a valid HashBinContainerType).
///
/// HashPrecisionBits is the number of bits used in the hashing functionality.
/// This defaults to FxDefaultHashPrecisionBits (12) resulting in 2^12 (4096)
/// hash bins and the result of the hashing function is masked
/// to fit in range [0, 2^HashPrecisionBits - 1].  The hashing function is 
/// optimized to result in zero collisions in 2^32.  Since a hash table with 
/// 2^32 elements is completely out of scope, we need to mask the 32-bit result 
/// to fit in in the hash table.  As a result, the hashing function will produce 
/// more collisions than it should theoretically.
