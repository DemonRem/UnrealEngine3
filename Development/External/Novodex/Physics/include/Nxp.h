	The below settings permit the debug visualization of various simulation properties.

	that determines the size of the visualization widgets.

	Only bodies and joints for which visualization is turned on using setFlag(VISUALIZE) are visualized.
	Contacts are visualized if they involve a body which is being visualized.
	Default is 0.

	Notes:
	- to see any visualization, you have to set NX_VISUALIZATION_SCALE to nonzero first.
	- the scale factor has been introduced because it's difficult (if not impossible) to come up with a
	good scale for 3D vectors. Normals are normalized and their length is always 1. But it doesn't mean
	we should render a line of length 1. Depending on your objects/scene, this might be completely invisible
	or extremely huge. That's why the scale factor is here, to let you tune the length until it's ok in
	your scene.
	- however, things like collision shapes aren't ambiguous. They are clearly defined for example by the
	triangles & polygons themselves, and there's no point in scaling that. So the visualization widgets
	are only scaled when it makes sense.
