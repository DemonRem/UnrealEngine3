\brief The user needs to implement this interface class in order to be notified when

Once you pass an instance of this class to #NxScene::setUserContactReport(),

for which this behavior was enabled.

You request which events are reported using NxScene::setActorPairFlags(), 
#NxScene::setShapePairFlags(), or #NxScene::getActorGroupPairFlags()

Please note: Kinematic actors will not generate contact reports when in contact with other kinematic actors.

 user thread.

\brief An interface class that the user can implement in order to modify contact constraints.

<b>Threading:</b> It is <b>necessary</b> to make this class thread safe as it will be called in the context of the
simulation thread. It might also be necessary to make it reentrant, since some calls can be made by multi-threaded
parts of the physics engine.

You can enable the use of this contact modification callback in two ways:
1. Raise the flag NX_AF_CONTACT_MODIFICATION on a per-actor basis.
or
2. Set the flag NX_NOTIFY_CONTACT_MODIFICATION on a per-actor-pair basis.

Please note: 
+ It is possible to raise the contact modification flags at any time. But the calls will not wake the actors up.
+ It is not possible to turn off the performance degradation by simply removing the callback from the scene, all flags needs to be removed as well.
+ The contacts will only be reported as long as the actors are awake. There will be no callbacks while the actors are sleeping.
