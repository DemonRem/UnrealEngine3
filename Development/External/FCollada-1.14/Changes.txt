Release 1.14
[2952 by glaforte] Performance improvement. Store all the FCDAnimated objects in a std::map, rather than a vector. This is a quick fix because we really should look for a better architecture for the animation/animated/channel structures.
[2949 by glaforte] Fixed recently-added and impossibly large leak.
[2941 by glaforte] Added FUBoundingBox class since much of that code was repeated in different classes.
[2937 by aazar] Added to FMVector4 a constructor, substraction and dot product
[2918 by glaforte] Completed the first prototype for the support of Unicode filenames: do not let LibXML handle the file open/save.
[2908 by glaforte] A little more precision in matrix inversion in order to support large scales.
[2902 by glaforte] Added case-insensitive comparison for Unicode strings.
[2882 by glaforte] Incremented the version numbers for the open-source COLLADA tools.
[2869 by ewhittom] Added material management for parameterized surfaces. The FCDGeometryNURBSSurface class now has a type (VERTEX, NORMAL or TEXTURE), and if this type is VERTEX it can now contain a pointer to another NURBS surface describing the texture coordinates applied to the real surface. ColladaMax: Added material export for NURBS. I used the GetCLPTextureSurfaceData method from the NURBSCVSurface class to get the texture date since the NURBSTextureSurface class doesn't contain all the needed information, only the CVs. The challenge will be to figure out how to import this texture surface back into Max... FViewer: Added material support for FRPSurface. The GLU tessellator gives me no error and good texture coordinates, but unfortunately the textures refuse to show up. The colors are fine though; the materials are used, but no texture even if the Use method is called from FRTexture... I use glTexCoord2fv, is there anything else I should call prior to use a texture in the Viewer ??? 
[2863 by glaforte] Fixed the cloning of an animated matrix that reversed the order of the values. 
[2860 by glaforte] Fixed the iterators so that the fill list is retrieved when the iterator is constructed or allocated. 
[2857 by glaforte] Implemented binary-sort version of tangent/binormal compression. 
[2853 by ewhittom] Added a texture coordinate source in the FCDGeometryNURBSSurface class along with import/export.
[2852 by glaforte] Fixed the cloning of mesh polygons, where the same matching was broken when cloning within the same document: the IDs were correctly modified in order to keep the uniqueness of ids. 
[2850 by glaforte] Fixed the import of textures in the viewer due to UNICODE / character confusion. 
[2843 by glaforte] Corrected the build for FColladaTest's Retail Unicode mix-up. 
[2840 by glaforte] Automated Build: Removed NAnt.build / Added CC.MSBuild parser. 
[2829 by glaforte] Added a FCDSceneNode sub-tree iterator structure. 
[2818 by glaforte] Implemented the document-aware cloning functions for scene nodes, entity instances and transforms. 
[2793 by glaforte] Added some FMVectorX -> FMColor conversion functions. Added a shortcut for adding functors to events. 
[2784 by glaforte] Added user-requested const-version of the FCDGeometryPolygons::FindInputs function. 
[2775 by glaforte] Added parent scene node link for the entity instances. Added functions to calculate transforms in the FCDSceneNode class as well as a few small shortcuts in the lights and object classes. 
[2774 by claforte] We noticed that the lzma compressor doesn't trigger any AVG false alarm, in addition to making the files much smaller. Changed all install scripts to use that compressor instead of the default bzip2. 
[2769 by glaforte] Mostly added external include guards. Added a few functions to help with the matrix composition: FMMatrix44::EulerRotationMatrix, FMMatrix44::ScaleMatrix, FMMatrix44::SetTranslation. 
[2759 by ewhittom] Changed the name of the FCDGeometryNURBSSurfaceSet entity to FCDGeometryPSurface. PSurface stands for "Parametrized Surface" and may include NURBS, BSPLINE and BEZIER patches among others. 
[2758 by glaforte] Fixed the build. 
[2757 by ewhittom] Added import of NURBS surfaces from XML and fixed the export by adding the inputs with the sources. TODO:  CVs animation should be supported. More tests with more complex test cases as for now only the simplest (low level) NURBS kinds are supported. 
[2755 by glaforte] Renamed the FCDPhysicsSceneNode into FCDPhysicsScene, which is more appropriate for the information contained in the structure. 
[2753 by glaforte] Refactored the splines and surface code to use FCDObject and RTTI correctly. 
[2750 by glaforte] Just added some external guards to give small speed-ups to the compilation. Removed the '#include "FCDocument/FCDocument.h"' from FCDObject.h too. 
[2747 by glaforte] FUObject: Two missing 'const' in the IsType() and HasType() RTTI-helpers 
[2744 by glaforte] FViewer: Implemented the selection rendering as a counter, rather than a flag, in order to support node instancing through entity instancing. Tested and fixed the hit-testing under various conditions: scales, skews, etc. Refactored the hit-testing and rendering code to support multi-parenting of visual scene nodes. Removed the assumption of correct winding in the triangle-ray intersection code. 
[2731 by glaforte] Added default values to the scene graph transforms. This is necessary when using the FCDx classes for scene graph operations with the viewer. 
[2730 by glaforte] Added some new shortcuts for RTTI in FUObject: (with automated tests.) FUObject::IsType() FUObject::HasType() and DynamicCast<FCDSomething(FUObject* object). 
[2729 by glaforte] FColladaTest: Fixed the output folders for the two new project configurations. 
[2728 by glaforte] Fixed the export of camera/light extras and the extra tree export/re-import test procedure: the light now exports <extra>s of its own. Added two libraries versions of the FCollada test project. 
[2727 by glaforte] FUtils: Reverted one of Alfred's last changes: UNC network paths are NOT file:\\\\\NETWORK. They are expressed correctly using the hostname: file:\\NETWORK\Filepath. 
[2726 by glaforte] FUtils: Just a typo corrected in the documentation. 
[2723 by ewhittom] Added data structures to support NURBS surfaces with trimmed curves. The NURBS surface structure looks like this: A NURBS surface set a the root of the FCDGeometry (along with meshes and splines) n NURBS surfaces in a set 1 set of control vertex, 2 degrees (u and v) and 2 knot vectors per surface n trim curve groups per surface n trim curves per group. A trim curve is basically a NURBS curve with 2D CVs. Each CV component must be included in the knot vector ranges (the surface domain) since the CVs do not represent positions in space, but positions in the 2D parametric domain of the surface. I created trim groups because both Max and the OpenGL GLU API (gluBeginTrim / gluEndTrim) work this way. Since they're NURBS, I used the FCDNURBSSpline structure to hold them in memory, but they're exported in a slightly different way to XML. Note: The added COLLADA elements are NOT part of the specification. ColladaMax: Added the export logic for NURBS surfaces and their trim curves. Using the surf_api wrapper, we determine if the object is a NURBS surface, then go through its associated NURBSSet to collect the needed surfaces and trim curves informations. The routines work for both CV and Point curves, but only export the CV curves and discards the point informations if any. 
[2723 by ewhittom] Note: The NURBSId members we should use to retrieve the curve's parent surface are incorrect, so I used the parent index in the set instead. Also, there's no clean way (or I haven't found one) to determine in which group the trim curve belongs other than parsing the Max curve name. This name has some information appended to it internally specifying its group index and sub-group index. The information appended to this name can't be affected except by the surf_api wrapper, so I guess we can rely on it. *** Coming soon: Import in Max. 
[2722 by glaforte] [Old work] Added check for no keys in the animation curve evaluation function. 
[2719 by glaforte] All projects are now in VS 2005 format. 
[2716 by glaforte] Fixed the build: missing FMVector4::One. 
[2715 by glaforte] Fixed up the imported version of the default transparency in the profile_COMMON material. 
[2708 by glaforte] Always let the transparency factor be 1, regardless of the transparency mode since we are multiplying it by the color. 
[2696 by glaforte] In order to support the export of transparency correctly: always initialize the version information structure. 
[2695 by glaforte] Reverted the change for issue #180. '.' and ':' are NOT valid NCName characters according to our validators. 
[2688 by glaforte] Fixed the material instance - polygons retrieval for controlled meshes. Added '#' as a valid XML character. 
[2679 by glaforte] Fixed a validation issue in the sub-instancing of physics models instances. 
[2674 by glaforte] Added support for 4D color animations. 
[2656 by glaforte] Fixed the build. 
[2654 by glaforte] Added a shortcut to the FCDMaterialInstance class to quickly look-up the associated FCDGeometryPolygons object. 
[2653 by glaforte] Added '\n' and '\r' as valid XML characters. 
[2648 by glaforte] Fixed the export of bad alpha in the reflection color out of ColladaMaya. 
[2642 by aleung] Fixed public bug #44 (Exported file contains inappropriate paths for the exported <image> elements with ColladaMaya 2.02) we now export networked files as file://///computerName/networkPath/file.dae instead of file://computerName/networkpath/file.dae we now can import uri of both forms mentioned above fixed undiscovered bug where networked paths were missing a "/" between the computerName and networkPath 
[2637 by aleung] Fixed breaking the build for ColladaMaya from last commit 
[2636 by aleung] Guillaume's fix for compilation error for feeling viewer 
[2635 by aazar] Fix for bug 180 on public bugzilla. Added all accepted NCName characters according to the W3C XML standard in the cleaning functions for id and name. 
[2631 by glaforte] Implemented the export of the visibility animations for scene node. 
[2626 by glaforte] Since filenames are much pickier than typical XML strings, wrote a second table for the valid filename characters and allowed more characters into the XML validity table. 
[2625 by glaforte] Modified the export so that most content values go through a converter. For performance reasons, the converter uses a Boolean table in order to validate a character. Removed the high-level processing code that is now replaced with the low-level code: with special consideration for filenames, that don’t accept spaces as a valid character. Modified the import to automatically convert the %XX tokens into valid UTF-8 characters.  ColladaMax: Modified the filename export in nVidia's import mechanism for ColladaFX to process spaces correctly. 
[2623 by aazar] Fixed compilation issue with FCDLight Fixed potential crash in FRMeshSkinController if the joint node is not found Placed all clearing functions in a separate static function in the FRSceneNode Added reading of the library_node and creation of all FRSceneNode. This fixes bug 170 in public bugzilla. 
[2622 by aleung] ColladaMaya: allowed export of mass, density, centerOfMass animation starting with default values for rigid bodies added a helper to CDagHelper to determine if a plug is connected to an animation FCollada: when exporting the centerOfMass in the library_physics_models, need to surround the translate/rotate elements with a mass_frame tag (was done in FCDPhysicsRigidBodyInstance, but missing from FCDPhysicsParameter) 
[2620 by glaforte] FS Public Bugzilla #161: Modified the FCDTargetedEntity class to handle its own reading/writing of the extra tree nodes to handle the target parameter. Refactored the light and camera export code to write the extra parameters into the FCollada profile and under an <extra> element. Fixed the import of the penumbra and fall-off angles.  ColladaMaya: Modified the export/import of ColladaMaya’s double-sided flag to use an <extra> element.  
[2619 by aleung] ColladaMaya: added support for exporting animated constrain and interpenetrate parameters from rigid constraints added support for exporting animated dynamic, mass, density, center of mass from rigid bodies mass, density, center of mass currently assumes that the initial value is not the default value. If so, no animation will be written because the parameters are not written if they are default FCollada: added some const versions of GetAnimatedEnabled and GetAnimatedInterpenetrate added support for exporting animated constrain and interpenetrate parameters from rigid constraints using WriteAnimatedValueToXML made AddParameter return the parameter after adding it to facilitate exporting animated parameters added support for exporting animated dynamic, mass, density, center of mass, and inertia from rigid bodies using WriteAnimatedValueToXML 
[2617 by glaforte] ColladaMaya: Implemented the support for XRef materials in ColladaMaya. Fixed the import/export of different materials on multiple mesh instances. FCollada: Fixed the export of the polygons material semantic for XRef material instances. 
[2609 by aleung] ColladaMaya: added importing animated mass, centerOfMass, inertiaTensor, and active parameters for rigid bodies FCollada: added support for importing animated mass, centerOfMass, inertiaTensor, and active parameters for rigid bodies by calling FCDAnimatedPoint3::Create and FCDAnimatedFloat::Create where appropriate 
[2608 by aleung] ColladaMaya: added import of the animated values for constrain and interpenetrate on rigid constraints FCollada: allow animated values for constrain and interpenetrate on rigid constraints by calling FCDAnimatedFloat::Create on them added the accessor methods to get the animated values 
[2605 by glaforte] Implemented the export of the transparency mode attribute for profile_COMMON effects. 
[2596 by glaforte] The splines support should use the POSITION semantic, rather than CVS. 
[2586 by glaforte] Fixed the export of some strange accessor parameters. 
[2584 by glaforte] Removed from FCDTexture a function declaration for a dead function. 
[2583 by glaforte] FUtils: Removed the singleton's friend helper, since MSVS 2005 doesn't accept this trick. Added a RemoveHandler function to the event class for static functions. 
[2581 by ewhittom] ColladaMax: Attempted to fix the quaternion to Euler problem we have at export. It is "partially" fixed: some conversions are correct, but some are not, which is catastrophic. I added two functions to perform the conversion and tested them, but they give wrong results some times. Example of a wrong result: DataSets/Collada/MayaExported/Animations/18_animated: joint #11. Max has a way to convert a Quaternion controller to an Euler controller (right-click on the quat controller in the Curve editor, select AssignController... and choose Euler XYZ), this method has almost perfect results, I wonder how they do that. Maybe the solution would be to find the way they convert this controller, clone our quaternion controller to have a copy, convert the copy to an Euler controller and then export it. Fixed an error in the FCDAnimationCurve::Ready function: the X and Y tangent components were inverted. Added some decimals to Pi to have more precision. 
[2575 by glaforte] Fixed the resizing of FCDExtra's custom animated structure. 
[2572 by ewhittom] ColladaMax: Added support for Max SkyLights. When we were exporting a SkyLight ColladaMax was crashing. This is because the SkyLight uses the IParamBlock2 interface for its parameters instead of the IParamBlock used by all the other lights. Also, this param block doesn't follow the other lights' pattern, so I had to find the parameter IDs myself and added them in the common Light.h file. All the SkyLight parameters except Color and Intensity are exported in a Max3D extra node called <skylight>, and they're not animated even though they could be in Max. The export/import has been tested and works well. I needed the MaterialExporter's ExportImage function, so now it's public. Just for fun I also checked with all the other Max lights available, and some other lights were crashing ColladaMax (area lights). I decided to silently drop the support for those weird lights, if anybody request that kind of support we'll add it. 
[2571 by aleung] ColladaMaya: fix the imported transformations so that rigid bodies with multiple shapes import correctly; the problem was because the first shape is created as the parent and the subsequent shapes of the same rigid body are created as children, so they inherit the transforms from the first shape as well. fixed the order of multiplication of the transforms and use the Decompose method to find the final rotation angles fixed all the findPlug calls in DaePhysicsMOdelLibrary so it will compile on Mac added GetPlugValue by float to CDagHelper FCollada: reverted changes to the Decompose method in FMMatrix44 from revision 2550 due to misunderstanding of the elements in the matrix fixed the Gimbal lock issue in the Decompose method where it returned an invalid rotation.x value is returned 
[2569 by glaforte] Another attempt to retrieve the FUObjectPtr's pointer in FUObjectRef. 
[2567 by glaforte] Wish these stupid compilers would agree on how to do templates. 
[2566 by macintosh] FCollada / ColladaMaya: Incomplete attempt to get these to compile on MacOSX. 
[2562 by glaforte] New MacOSX project file, provided by Randall Rickert. 
[2561 by ewhittom] ColladaMax: XRefing quick fix Added a FCDocument to the XRefManager to create the temporary entities. FCollada: Added a "UseExternalReferenceID" (default = false) member to the FCDEntityInstance class to force the WriteToXML method to use the external reference ID instead of the entity ID. 
[2560 by glaforte] Some compilation fixes for non-windows OSes that were given by Randall Rickert. 
[2558 by aleung] ColladaMaya: allow for multiple shapes in a rigid body fixed some GetNode issues when rigid bodies have same name but on different branch of hierarchy FCollada: made IsAnalyticalGeometry const 
[2557 by ewhittom] ColladaMax: XRefing XRefs now work on Max. The features include: Geometry x-refing (<instance_geometry>) Material x-refing (<instance_material>) Nested x-refing. Cycle detection and abortion LIMITATIONS: Currently only available for 3dsMax 8, Max 7 fails to import XRefs. Everything has been tested using the CTF, test cases will be committed shortly. The FCollada dereference flag is now set to false on ColladaMax. (BUG: there is a stack overflow when there's a cycle in the dependencies). Modified the GeometryImporter's Finalize method to accomodate XRefMaterials. Added a Finalize method for the XRefImporter doing a minimal material assignment. Added a new MaxScript extension to generate a Collada ID from a Max Material (used in name-matching) Modified the NodeExporter to detect XREF type and override it when Skin or Morph controllers are applied to the XRef object (FCollada limitation). Added a GetSourceName in the XRefManager to accomodate ID creation. Cycle detection works this way: a file named FILE_STACK is created once and updated in each Max session spawned. Just before spawning a new Max session to import XRefs, the program checks in the FILE_STACK file to see if it's own DAE file is in there. If so, it aborts, and the root session instantiate a dummy. 
[2557 by ewhittom] Modified the log and script file names to be time-dependant, to avoid IO errors during nested XRef resolution. Modified the ResolveName method to accomodate XRefMaterials FCollada: Modified the FCDEntityInstance WriteToXML method to use the external reference URI whenever possible. Modified the FCDMaterialInstance LoadFromXML method to accomodate external references. TODO:  Test the limitations. Test with 3dsMax 7. 
[2554 by glaforte] Fixed the build. SVN tricked me yesterday and I forgot to submit this piece of code! 
[2550 by aleung] ColladaMaya: implemented import of analytic shapes fixed problem where the rotate and translate attributes in the shape node where not being interpreted when importing rigid bodies FCollada: fixed some indexing and negation problems with the Decompose method in FMMatrix44 
[2548 by glaforte] Added to FCDAnimatedCustom a resize function to easily export color animations in the extra tree nodes. ColladaMax: Fixed the import and export of vertex position animations: the conversion functions were not properly applied to the 2D animation tangents. Implemented a first prototype of the export of custom attributes. 
[2545 by glaforte] Fixed the MSVS 2003 build: the FUObjectRef template needed a few adjustments from its MSVS 2005 version. ColladaMax: Fixed the build: removed unnecessary input library, in Debug Max 8, for the new ColladaMaxScript project. 
[2541 by glaforte] FViewer: Added FRObject class which ties in the FCDObject with some FR structure. Also added RTTI and containment on many of the FR structures. 
[2539 by glaforte] Added dirty flag and SetDirtyFlag calls spread throughout FCollada. 
[2525 by glaforte] Fixed the Unicode builds. 
[2524 by ewhittom] Removed one check in the GetExternalReference method from FCDEntityInstance, it now creates the xref even if the entity is not null. It was needed since we create full instances when exporting XRefs, only we don't add them to the Geometry library if the XRef export option is turned on. So from now on just check IsExternalReference before trying to get it. 
[2517 by glaforte] Added two project configurations to FColladaTest and modified FCTest.cpp, in order to make its test cases accessible to higher-level applications. Fixed a MSVS 2005 STL exception with respect to iterating over the external references when the external references are re-writting themselves. 
[2516 by glaforte] Made the FColladaTest project use $(ProjectDir) instead of $(SolutionDir). 
[2509 by glaforte] Fixed the curve merging generation of flat tangents: since we have absolute 2D control points, take into consideration the closest curve point's value to determine the 2D control point's values. 
[2505 by glaforte] Fixed typo in the 2D animation tangent import code that was causing ColladaMaya to drop tangents. 
[2504 by glaforte] ColladaMax: Removed more IGame usage in the GeometryExporter class. More importantly: fixed the instantiation of rare materials: the color material and multi-material override types should now work. And the stability is back on! 
[2503 by glaforte] Added FUXmlDocument containment class to make automated test cases that use XML documents easier to write. Modified FCDocument to use FUXmlDocument. 
[2501 by glaforte] All: A first batch of MSVS 2005 support fixes. 
[2500 by glaforte] Patch provided by Esteban Castro for disfunctional FCDTRotation::IsInverse function. 
[2499 by glaforte] ColladaMax/ColladaMaya Both translators now uses the new texture tangent generation code. ColladaMax: Fixed the missing normals issue when exporting a converted TriObject. 
[2498 by glaforte] Removed the triangulation functions from the FCDGEometryMesh/FCDGeometryPolygons class and moved them to a new, neutral namespace: FCDGeometryPolygonsTools. Added the tangent-basis vector creation functionality for meshes to the polygons tools. FCTools: Added a tool to generate the tangent-basis vectors for all the meshes of a document: FCDProcessMeshes. This tool can definitely be improved upon in order to make it a real conditioner, some day! 
[2495 by glaforte] Small clean-up due to the interface addition in FCDExtra. 
[2488 by glaforte] Added support for 2D animation tangents, as proposed by SoftImage. Added backward-compatible import of the 2D animation tangents by transforming the 1D animation tangents. All weight information is dropped and not imported. Fixed some of the automated tests that were failing: file manager/cross-cloning.. 
[2485 by ewhittom] Fixed a bug in FCDExtra when attempting to write a NULL FCDAnimatedCustom to XML. 
[2471 by ewhittom] ColladaMax: Added Multi-pass effects export for cameras. Since those parameters aren't in the spec they're exported as <extra> nodes: 3DSMAX profile for Motion Blur, and FCOLLADA profile for the Depth of Field. Those parameters are animated using the newly fixed FCDAnimatedCustom class. I created methods to automate the export task as much as possible without limiting the flexibility (ordering is still possible, and renaming of a single parameter is still easy). Currently, the boolean values are not animated. TODO: Add the import mechanisms. 
[2464 by aazar] Added version numbers in the document, and comparison functions to check if we're lower/higher than a given version. This now allows to support correctly transparency for both 1.4.1 and pre-1.4.1. 
[2463 by glaforte] Fixed the export of the targets for the FCDAnimatedCustom class, which fixed the export of ColladaMaya/ColladaMax animated texturing properties. 
[2453 by aazar] Fixed transparency for all 1.3 and max datasets by setting the default opaque mode to RGB_ZERO, and making sure the default value for the alpha component of colors is 1.0f, and the default translucency factor is 0.0f. If we switch to A_ONE as default, the default translucency factor should also change to 1.0f. Fixed John's bug #345 of the mysterious muffler face for his 3D character. We were not checking the symbols locally for each geometry and thus assigning wrong textures. 
[2450 by aleung] fixed the file paths from network drives (\\shared\etc): we don't want to strip out the scheme fixed file paths with "%" not loading: we don't want to escape unless it is a uri and we want a file path, so moved code from SplitURI to GetFilePath ColladaMaya: fixed bug where some textures were still having "\" appended to the end of the file path by Maya 
[2448 by glaforte] Modified the FCDPhysicsShape class to not be based on top of the FCDEntity class, but the FCDObject class. ColladaMaya: Followed the above changes. 
[2441 by glaforte] Fixed some physics-related validation issue. 
[2440 by ewhittom] Fixed a Win32-related bug in the string builder when feeding it division by zero results. The #IND00 NaN representation is not the same as the std::numeric_limits #QNAN00. 
[2432 by claforte] Updated FCollada installer to include sample source code and projects. Also had to package DevIL since it’s required to build one of the samples. 
[2425 by glaforte] Updated my old packaging script to include the test code folders in the automated test project correctly. 
[2423 by claforte] Added pre-requisites and license info for FCollada, ColladaMaya and ColladaMax. Modified the installers accordingly. 
[2416 by aazar] Fixed transparency bug where opacity was inversed. 

Release 1.13 [Rev.2415]
[  aleung 25-07-06] Fixed the bug where the Collada 1.3 skinned animations would not display the mesh.
[   aazar 25-07-06] Added support for RGB_ZERO and A_ONE modes of opacity (public bug 87). Converted the color pipeline from FCollada-FCTranslator-FRenderer to use 4 components. Modified the constant color shader to correctly compute the alpha. However, we're not computing the real RGB transparencies as defined in the spec as this would require a pretty convoluted multipass, at least until the graphics card become programmable at the blending level.
[glaforte 21-07-06] First attempt at refactoring the FUFileManager to handle UNC paths and drive letters correctly for all Win32 paths and to generate correct URIs according to RFC 3986. Added a test for backward compatibility with the old exported paths in the FUFileManager automated test.
[  aleung 21-07-06] Added missing members in the cloning of the FCDGeometryPolygons; this corrects a crash in ColladaMaya when importing some physics scenes
[glaforte 20-07-06] Allow the XRef of DAE documents without <scene> elements in FCollada
[glaforte 20-07-06] Issue #97: corrected the release of scene nodes for MSVS 2005.
[ewhittom 19-07-06] Improved the support for 3dsMax lights.
[glaforte 19-07-06] Improved support for XRef of geometries/controllers/lights/cameras. Some FCollada clean-up for document placeholder support in XRef code.
[ewhittom 18-07-06] Added functionality to FCDGeometryMesh to determine if the mesh is all triangles.
[   aazar 18-07-06] Fixed bug in FCollada that would prevent correct reading of rigid constraints. The sid was interpreted as a global id and name clashes could occur. The instantiation would then fail.
[   aazar 18-07-06] Added linking of the meshes in the FCDocument. Fixed cloning of FCDGeometryMesh and WriteToXML for convex meshes. Added export of convex_mesh for convex physics shapes, using convex_hull_of and creating a second geometry
[glaforte 17-07-06] Added a few searching functions to FCollada: FindEntity and FindLayer. Fixed the FCollada compilation and the material automated test to follow the latest changes.
[  aleung 14-07-06] Fixed problem with filepaths and external referencing... they were still not using the API for GetFilePath and GetFileURL appropriately. Fixed some unicode stuff in the url/filepath conversion. MakeFilePathRelative now returns the os-dependent filepath, just like MakeFilePathAbsolute
[claforte 14-07-06] Added first version of the installer.
[  aleung 13-07-06] Fixed reopened public bug #68: Filenames/uris with special characters cause problems. Fixed the url to filepath conversion: it was escaping all "%" symbol even if it was already escaped. Fixed the filepath to url conversion by removing invalid characters and replacing them with the hex values. Update all the calls to these two methods to respect the api (no need to "ensure it is url" or vice versa).
[glaforte 12-07-06] Fixed the automatic import of external document placeholders in FCollada.
[ewhittom 12-07-06] FCDGeometrySpline: Moved the "Type" and "Degree" attributes to an extra node ("FCOLLADA" profile) in order to pass schema validation. Validation tested using the CTF "Validate" operation.[ewhittom 12-07-06] Fatal error when exporting sampled curves with LINEAR interpolation. We were trying to access the empty in/out tangents vectors.
[ewhittom 12-07-06] Fixed fatal error when exporting sampled curves with LINEAR interpolation. We were trying to access the empty in/out tangents vectors.
[glaforte 12-07-06] Added support for the import/export of the profile_COMMON sampler/surface parameter when texturing. Removed the FCDTexture extra parameters from FCollada and moved them to ColladaMaya and ColladaMax in order to reduce the clutter in FCollada.
[  aleung 11-07-06] Fixed public Bug #68: Filenames/uris with special characters cause problems. high level solution for having "&" in file path which is a special character in xml... just fix the filepath accordingly when exporting... this is done during asset, effect, and image export
[   aazar 11-07-06] Fixed bug affecting LINE_STRIPS in FCDGeometryPolygonsSpecial. Added CLEAR_ARRAY_VECTOR macro to clear vectors of arrays.
[  aleung 11-07-06] Fixed public bug #44: Exported file contains inappropriate paths for the exported <image> elements. Added consideration for paths beginning "//" and "\\" as network paths instead of simple delimiters. Added check for Unicode characters
[   aazar 10-07-06] Modified FCollada to keep a list of number of vertices to use for the special geometries (strips and fans). This is necessary when we have multiple <p> elements defined in the mesh, as all the indices get bundled together inside the same list and we have no info to separate them again. Completed the WriteToXML function for special geometries
[   aazar 10-07-06] Fixed bug #24 in the public bugzilla by reading in assets in FCollada, and processing their scale and up axis. Added an FCDAsset to the FCDSceneNode class.
[   zhang 10-07-06] Fill the clone() function of FCDPhysicsModel; Retrieve the content of <instance_node> from FCDSceneNode.
[   aazar 07-07-06] Added preliminary support for triangle fans, triangle strips, lines and line strips in FCollada through a new class named FCDGeometryPolygonsSpecial. This class derives from FCDGeometryPolygons and re-implements the appropriate functions. However, the implementation of the class is not yet complete as we would have to make several modifications to FCDGeometryMesh to have it support these primitives too. Will check with Guillaume if it's worth it.
[ewhittom 07-07-06] Added some operators in the FMVector4 class to help with the rational CV form used in NURBS.
[ewhittom 06-07-06] Added FCD[Spline|BezierSpline|NURBSSpline] classes inside FCDGeometrySpline.cpp to add better control over splines representations. Implemented the XML import/export according to the proposal I made earlier this week to the COLLADA mailing list. Added a Bezier-to-NURBS algorithm which converts a FCDBezierSpline to a group of FCDNURBSSpline correctly. I've been working on an algorithm to create a *single* NURB from a group of Bezier segments: it isn't perfect or complete but the code is still there between comments since it gives a pretty good approximation using variable CV multiplicity to control the wanted continuity in the NURB.
[  aleung 04-07-06] Added division with a scalar in FMVector3. Added a determinant method and a scalar multiplication operator to FMMatrix44
[   aazar 03-07-06] Fixed a couple of potential crashes.
[  aleung 03-07-06] Added matrix*vector4 operation to FMMatrix44
[   aazar 29-06-06] Modified attribute initialization to match Collada defaults, and added flags to determine if we're using maya or max specific attributes.
[glaforte 29-06-06] Yesterday's start of work on cloning refactoring for cross-document copies.
[glaforte 29-06-06] Hierarchical Animations: Added support, in FCollada, for the import of animation curve sources that are higher in the hierarchy that the <sampler>/<channel> element.
[   aazar 27-06-06] Read in <param> in the profile_common elements such as diffuse, emission, etc. Fixed bug 348 in Khronos Bugzilla.
[  aleung 23-06-06] Added GetParent to FCDGeometryMesh.

Release 1.12 [Rev.2152]
[glaforte 22-06-06] Restored the packaging/building of the FCollada static libraries. Deleted the old library vcproj. Added two sample command-line tools.
[ewhittom 22-06-06] Also exposed a new parameter for FCDLight: default target distance; that is the target distance when the light has no target.
[glaforte 21-06-06] Attempt to predict the amount of memory necessary for the indices, rather than count it, as it implies parsing the integers twice. Don't try to allocate 400 megs of memory (sorry about this). Also: pre-allocate the traversal buffer when calculating the animation target.
[ewhittom 21-06-06] FCDEffectStandard: Added two methods to add <extra> parameters to its parent effect. From now on, the max-specific parameters are exported and imported from the MAX extra profile node using those methods. TODO. Move the currently created Maya extra parameters from the EffectStandard to its parent.. FCDAnimatedColor: Added a FMVector4 version for alpha. FCDEffectParameterVector: Now uses FMVector4 instead of (float vector[4]).
[ewhittom 20-06-06] I added full HLSL support, and a generic way to compare FCDEffectParameter objects (used this to avoid duplicates between <newparam> and <setparam> nodes)
[glaforte 20-06-06] Fixed the hexadecimal to string conversion. Fixed the export of the ambient color. Corrected the export of the specular factor Max-specific parameter. 
[glaforte 19-06-06] Fixed uninitialized memory access in FMColor. Added the conversion of integers to an hexadecimal string value in the string builder template. Fixed the CleanName function that should not be more restrictive in terms of the characters is allows.
[glaforte 15-06-06] Added a new default conversion functor for offsets. 
[glaforte 14-06-06] Added support for dereferencing external references in FCollada in entity instances. Added support for multiple documents being opened and referenced together in FCollada. Changes provided by Chris Trimble to better support VS2005.
[  aleung 14-06-06] Fixed memory leak in FCollada. Extra debugging code that Guillaume added to FUObject.
[glaforte 13-06-06] Corrected the exported type of the <asset><up_axis> element.

Release 1.11 [Rev.2036]
[glaforte 09-06-06] Fixed the export of the <up_axis> element. Export the code includes as relative paths. Corrected a validation issue with respect to the animated morph target weights and their animation curve sources accessor parameters. 
[glaforte 08-06-06] Issue #269: Large Holed Mesh Export Crash. The issue seems to be that the number of holes that occurs before a given face is invalid on export. Fixed the counting of the number of holes appearing before a given face index.
[glaforte 07-06-06] Fixed up the import/export of the ColladaMaya ColladaFX render node. Added a flag in the file manager to enforce absolute URLs.
[  aleung 07-06-06] implemented animation curves that have keys dependent on their animation clips' start and end times
[glaforte 06-06-06] Added the export of the animated effect parameters: float, float3 and float4.
[  aleung 05-06-06] Guillaume's fixes in FCDLibrary and FCDAnimation relating to animation curves not being assigned animation clips. 
[glaforte 05-06-06] Small corrections: don't export all the light parameters for all the light types. Added an object track list for the animated elements. Added default sub-ids for the visual scene node transforms.
[   zhang 02-06-06] Export <bind_vertex_input> under material instance for COLLADA 1.4.1 .
[   zhang 02-06-06] Export shader source file as URL, fixed a bug in the FUFileManager::GetFileURL().
[   aazar 01-06-06] Fixed bug when reading images from a cube map.
[glaforte 01-06-06] Handle the special case where the COLLADA file is saved directly in the root folder and has relative file names included. 
[glaforte 01-06-06] Corrected the schema validation issue plaguing ColladaMaya. It seems that <instance_physics_scene> must occur before <instance_visual_scene>.
[   aazar 31-05-06] Fixed typo that prevented correct export of rigid constraint instances.

Release 1.10 [Rev.1963]
[   aazar 31-05-06] Fix for node instantiation.
[glaforte 31-05-06] Add missing Link for materials. Take the length conversion factor into consideration when exporting vertex positions, transforms and matrices that include a length value. Some documentation for existing structures.
[   zhang 31-05-06] FXC inter-operable fix. To <surface>: fill default <format> info; add type-"2D" attribute. To <samplerX>: remove <mipfilter>.
[   aazar 31-05-06] Fixed the WriteToXML of FCDPhysicsRigidBodyInstance to remove the url and write out correctly the target node. Also made sure we have materials before trying to write them. Fixed the gravity and timestep exporting in FCDPhysicsSceneNode. Various fixes in FCDPhysicsShape. Added a RemoveAttribute function in FUXmlWriter. Fixed destructor that would cause a crash with the new containers.
[   zhang 31-05-06] Fixed a bug failed to load image from <surface>. TempNames is not used.
[glaforte 31-05-06] Last week's work on surface-parameter and image linking. Includes a few modifications proposed for VS2005 support.
[   aazar 30-05-06] Fixed export of surfaces with 1.4.1 spec.
[   aazar 29-05-06] Fixed many crashes related to the new multi containers (not using the CLEAR_POINTER_VECTOR macro anymore, and simply clearing the lists). Fixed some physics bugs related to the type of a physics model not being read in correctly. Fixed mass/density computations for physics. Miscellaneous other fixes.
[   aazar 26-05-06] Fixed FCDPhysicsRigidBodyInstance, completed FCDPhysicsShape::WriteToXML and fixed some parameters.
[glaforte 26-05-06] Added more automated test: a couple of rigid bodies and rigid constraints are created. One rigid body and one rigid constraint will remain empty. The others have some parameters set. Fixed the export/import of rigid constraints to support target/reference scene nodes.
[   aazar 26-05-06] Completed the surface element by adding format, format_hint, and writing out all the other parameters. Added them in FUDaeSyntax.h too. Added support in FCollada for convex_mesh elements, mesh linking, and generating a convex mesh using PhysX in the FRenderer. Completed the WriteToXML for FCDPhysicsParameter, FCDRigidBodyInstance, and FCDPhysicsRigidConstraintInstance. Removed vector clearing from the destructor of the rigid bodies. Added some security checks in FUObject.h
[glaforte 26-05-06] Fixed the export of the ColladaFX surface init_X parameters. Added the export/re-import of the sampler/surface parameters to the automated test.
[glaforte 26-05-06] Physics Export: Continued writing the physics automated test: for physics model and improved the test for physics materials. Fixed the export of the physics material. For rigid bodies and rigid constraints: these should stay entities, but need to export a sub-id rather than a full ‘id’.
[   zhang 26-05-06] Add "#" before target attribute: <instance_material symbol="colladafxShader1SG" target="#colladafxShader1">
[glaforte 26-05-06] Added an automated test code file for the physics classes. Started writing an automated test for the export/re-import of the physics materials. Modified the source packaging script to include the FColladaTest project. Modified the release license for the FColladaTest source files.
[glaforte 25-05-06] Fixed the export of holes: the <ph> element was always used. There was some confusion in the indexation of faces and holes. Fixed the counting of the polygons per polygon set. Added backward compatibility for the old merged interpolation values: one interpolation value was exported for each dimension of the merged curve, while we now export/import only one interpolation value for each key in the merged curve. Don’t allow the merging of curves that have different interpolations methods. 
[glaforte 25-05-06] Corrected some leaks/release issues.
[glaforte 24-05-06] For rigid constraints: you can now target scene nodes. Added backward compatibility for the 'rest_length' spring parameter.
[glaforte 24-05-06] Making war on sids. Removed them from the functions, at least. Renamed to GetSubId and SetSubId.
[glaforte 24-05-06] On export: don’t export the in-tangents, out-tangents and interpolation sources for animation curves, if they are empty. Do export the empty input and output sources though. Added support for the export of animated in the geometry source. More modifications to the interface of the FCollada physics classes: this time to the physics instances. Added the pushing of new rigid body/constraint instances in a physics model instance and cleaned up the constructors and the entity retrieval/modification interface.
[glaforte 23-05-06] Fixed the import/export of animation drivers.
[glaforte 23-05-06] Since the animated class is required to assign the qualifiers and the target to the animation channels on export. And since clips currently generate multiple animation curves: implemented the support for multiple animation curves for each qualifier in the FCDAnimated class. Modified ColladaMaya to use the standard import matrix sampling algorithm for scene nodes. Fixed the curve merging algorithm, on export, by enforcing the default values in all the channels. This information should be relatively correct for exported document. When imported, and split again: the merged curves have the wrong key interpolation. Fixed the issue with the missing qualifiers when exporting merged animation curves.
[glaforte 23-05-06] Added more mutators to the physics classes. Added the export/import of the force field information. The force field information is simply a second FCDExtra for the non-COMMON techniques, as there is no COMMON profile for the force field.
[glaforte 23-05-06] Modified a few physics classes to use the new containers and provide some mutators.
[glaforte 22-05-06] Added RTTI to FCDControllerInstance class. Added onto RTTI a typedef for the parent class, so that the header now defines the parent directly using the 'Parent' token. Simplified the creation of singletons, they are now similar to the RTTI declaration/implementation.
[glaforte 20-05-06] Simpler assertion for memory checks.
[glaforte 20-05-06] Removed memory leaks. Added exception-handling for the release build. Added memory corruption tests.
[glaforte 19-05-06] Modified the physics FCDx classes to use the new containers and added information pushing/retrieval functions to these classes as well. Added a force field library and two new force field-related classes: FCDForceField and FCDForceFieldInstance. Since there is no COMMON profile information in either class, they will remain simple. Added the export of the four physical element libraries.
[glaforte 19-05-06] In order to pull out data structures, I wrote some templates for multi-containment and object tracking. I added two classes between FUObject and FUObjectContainer: FUObjectTracker is an interface for the object-release callback and FUObjectList is a vector of objects that are tracked, so that if one gets released, the list is updated automatically. As such, the FUObjectContainer class is based on the FUObjectList: when the container is released, all the objects are released and you can easily create new objects through the container. Modified the object automated test suite to test the new interface. 
[glaforte 19-05-06] Re-organized the automated tests and the testing framework to bring the test code closer to the tested code. Modified FCDocument to use as its parent, the new FUObjectContainer class; modified FCDObject to hold its own FCDocument, rather than through the container interface of FUObject; modified the libraries to contain the entities directly. Improved the automated testing so that it checks for memory leaks. 
[glaforte 19-05-06] Wrote two more tracker templates for simple pointers: FUObjectPtr and FUObjectRef, where the object reference releases the pointer when it is released. Modified all the non-physics FCDx classes to use the object trackers. Removed the ReleaseX functions that are now unnecessary. The FCDGeometryPolygonInput class and the entity instantiation classes also use the FUObjectTracker interface and track the source data and the instantiated entities, respectively. This is useful so that when an entity is released, all its instances are released automatically.
[glaforte 17-05-06] Added support for the export/import of ColladaFX annotations. Removed the temporary support for the min/max on the float parameters. Some validation issues fixed: the order of the <skeleton> element and the missing sid/ref (because they are empty) on exported parameters.
[glaforte 17-05-06] Added controller instance class to generate the <skeleton> elements.
[glaforte 17-05-06] Added a short automated test to verify the export/import of the extra information for the FCDGeometrySource class.
[   aazar 16-05-06] Fixed minor bug in physics. Added message reporting to the user if a warning or error occurred.
[glaforte 16-05-06] Added a wanted sub-id to transforms. Temporarily disabled the curve merging on channel export: until I can grab the null curves from the animated object. Added conversion interfaces for the animation curves. Fixed the cloning of the extra trees. Added an extra tree to the FCDGeometrySource object. Allow the animation of only the angle of a rotation.
[   aazar 15-05-06] Modified whole debugOut system. Use now DEBUG_OUT[12] for outputting debug messages, and WARNING_OUT[12] and ERROR_OUT[12] for warnings and errors in the log file. In Release mode, only WARNING_OUT and ERROR_OUT have an effect. Fixed physics crash if PhysX library doesn't initialize.
[glaforte 14-05-06] Added Retail configurations.

Release 1.09
[glaforte 12-05-06] Corrected the Release builds: The test bed's FailIf() function was using a debug-only feature.
[ewhittom 12-05-06] Fixed error with fstring == string.
[   zhang 12-05-06] Do not delete existing profiles of the same type when adding new profiles to effect, because there will be multiple CG profiles on different platforms (OGL-PC and PS3). Search profile by type and platform.
[glaforte 11-05-06] External references now export a correct filename. Added FUTestBed class for FColladaTest and any other automated, program code testing. Added IsEquivalent template function based on the operator==.
[glaforte 11-05-06] Export: Added a user handle to the FCDObject class. This should help to track translator objects related to the FCDx objects. Added the XML export code for the layer information and adapted the visual scene export/re-import automated test to verify layer information. 
[   zhang 11-05-06] Add tolerance to load empty <newparam>.
[   aazar 10-05-06] Added a check for the addition of NULL parameters in ColladaFX and material flattening.
[glaforte 09-05-06] Added RTTI information to all FUObject derivates. The FUObjectType class is used for this. I have not taken out the GetType() functions. Improved FUAssert to not break at the assertion point and FUEvent to remove handlers correctly, using a template function. Improved FMArray's vector definition.
[glaforte 09-05-06] Curve Merging: Write an automated test to help verify and rewrite the multi-curve merging algorithm. Rewrote the multi-curve merging algorithm: the tangents are transformed into angles, since that’s preserved for any given key during the merge, and transformed back into relative dY values at the end. The in-tangent angles for the sampled points on the curves are calculated using a dT that of 1ms, on one side. The out-tangent angles are always equal to the in-tangent angles since the curve should be smooth.
[glaforte 05-05-06] Export and Documentation: Added the ability to create the simple external reference scheme FCollada supports within the visual scene graph. Added to the automated test the instantiation of an external reference. Implemented the export of the external reference and the COLLADA 1.4 import of these external references. Added automatic generation of material semantics, when assigning polygons sets with materials during the instantiation. Added modifiers and better accessors for the material instance bindings. Added the export of the material instance bindings. Improved the automated test for the export/re-import of CG effect: added checks for the technique, pass, code.
[glaforte 05-05-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDEntityInstance class and added function modifiers to it. Added an automated test that instantiates entities and some materials. Added to the scene graph node a couple functions to create/release entity instances. Because I am duplicating a lot of small code: added find and per-value erase functions to our STL vector wrapper.

Release 1.08
[   zhang 04-05-06] FXC exports images within <effect>, but ColladaMaya looks for images in <library_images>. Disable the error return in image loading in FCDEffectParameterSurface, and add the dump of images in the FCDEffect.
[glaforte 03-05-06] Export and Documentation: Documenting the FCDSceneNode class. Added the FCDTFactory class to easily create and import new transforms. Fixed the parenting of transforms inside scene nodes. Changed the visual scene node’s target flag into a target counter, in case there are multiple cameras/lights that target the same visual scene node. Documented the FCDTransform class and all its up-classes.
[   aazar 03-05-06] Fixed with Guillaume a curve cloning issue and removed the ownsCurve boolean from FCDAnimated. 
[   aazar 02-05-06] Fixed a code typo that prevented the loading of some physics scenes.
[glaforte 02-05-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDAnimation class and added necessary functions to insert/release/retrieve child elements. Documented/refactored the FCDAnimated base class and its many up-classes. Wrote an automated test procedure for the animation tree export/re-import. Added to this test the creation of an animation curve and placing that animation curve to affect one component of a light color. Added and implemented generic creating functions for the typed animated up-classes: these will be used to add animation curves. To add new animations, I need access to the animatable parameters directly, so I added to cameras, lights, materials and effect parameters accessor that return the float references not as constant. Documented the FCDAnimationChannel class and added the necessary mutators/curve insertion/release functionality. Documented the FCDAnimationCurve class and the FCDAnimationMultiCurve class.
[glaforte 02-05-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FUDaeWriter namespace. Documented the FUCrc32 namespace, the FUDebug and the FUAssert functions, the FUObject and the FUObjectContainer classes.
[   aazar 28-04-06] Implemented Guillaume's suggestion for FCDEffectParameterSurfaceInit and created a factory along with clone methods. It might be a good idea to move these guys to a new file though, as FCDEffectParameterSurface.h/cpp are getting crowded.
[glaforte 28-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDExtra tree class and its technique/node sub-classes, also added the necessary information modifying/pulling and pushing functionality. Wrote an automated test for the export/re-import of a custom <extra> information tree. Documented the FUUniqueStringMapT template and started documenting the FUDaeWriter.h namespace.
[   zhang 28-04-06] Added "channels" and "format_hint" COLLADA tokens.
[glaforte 28-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FUStringConversion, the FCDEntity, the FCDTargetedEntity classes.
[glaforte 25-04-06] Export and Documentation: Added an automated import/re-export test for a simple skin controller with two joints and on top of a mesh. Added one automated import/re-import test for a simple morpher on top of spline. Fixed the export of the skin controller: wrong count on the accessor of the bind-pose source and the wrong source id was used for the influence weight input in the <vertex_weights> element. Added an automated test for the export/re-import of the orthographic camera.
[glaforte 25-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDEffectParameterSurface class, its initialization method sub-classes, the FCDController class, the FCDSkinController class and the FCDMorphController class. Added the FCDMorphTarget class, as the weight must now be attached to the controller at all times: before, I had a separate STL vector with the weights and on a resize, all the animations would have been lost. Added modifiers/pullers and pushers to these classes. Fixed ColladaMaya, ColladaMax and the viewer for the interface change in the morph controller class.
[   aazar 25-04-06] Fixed bug that would cause crash in FCDMaterialInstance if a controller had another controller as a base target. Fixed a bug where the wrong nodes would be sent to the animation linking, preventing correct shading animation. Fixed driven animation by fixing some bugs in FCollada for the driver.
[glaforte 25-04-06] Documentation and Export: Documented the FCDEffectParameterSurface class and its initialization method sub-classes. Added modifiers/pullers and pushers to these classes.
[glaforte 25-04-06] Fixed the import of the orthographic camera: it always failed as the camera strangely became both orthographic and perspective at the same time.
[glaforte 24-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDImage class and added new modifiers/pullers/pushers. Modified the automated export/re-import test for the profile COMMON material to include a few textures and added the export/re-import of a few images for these textures. Fixed the export of COLLADA images: the id was missing and the filename was not a valid URL. Documented the FCDEffectParameterFactory class, the FCDEffectParameterList class, the FCDEffectParameter class and most of its derivates: the FCDEffectParameterSurface class is not yet documented. Added modifiers/pullers and pushers to all these classes, as well. Improved the document parsing error reporting by adding the line number on all the warnings/errors reported.
[glaforte 22-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDTexture class. The FCDEffectStandard class now always owns all its textures, as I added the texture push/pull for this class. It will be easier that way for COLLADA 1.3 backward compatibility: the texture entities are cloned. Documented the FCDEffectPassShader and fixes a few typos and grammar mistakes in the documentation.
[glaforte 21-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDEffectTechnique class and the FCDEffectPass class. Documented the FCDEffectCode class. Fixed the STL-related doxygen warnings.
[   aazar 20-04-06] Added a check for zero-length in FMVector3::NormalizeIt().
[glaforte 20-04-06] Export and Documentation: The output file for the export/re-import automated test is starting to contain important information: ran it through a XML validator and fixed the validation issues: quite a few missing ‘sid?and ‘url?attributes, as well as quite a few required nodes: ?node> in an empty visual scene? ?pass> in an empty effect technique?.. 
[glaforte 20-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDEffectStandard class and the FCDEffectProfileFX class. Wrote two automated tests for the export and re-import of the CG and COMMON profile materials. Simplified the documentation, removing all the "defines a" and "defines the", to be simply "A" and "The".
[glaforte 20-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDEffect class. I realized that the FCDEffect class can still hold only one effect profile. Renamed the FCDEffectProfile class into the FCDEffectProfileFX class. Created a new FCDEffectProfile class which is the base class for the FCDEffectProfileFX and the FCDEffectStandard classes. Refactored the FCDEffect class to contain a list of FCDEffectProfile objects. Documented/implemented the FCDEffectProfile class. Updated ColladaMaya, ColladaMax and the Feeling Viewer to use the new effect/profile architecture.
[   aazar 19-04-06] Fixed material instancing issue with geometry controllers.
[glaforte 17-04-06] Export and Documentation: Started writing the export-import test for the materials/effects classes. Documented the FCDMaterialLibrary and FCDMaterial classes. Removed the ClearDaeIdWithoutTouchingTheUniqueMap function from the FCDObjectWithId class and refactored the import of materials to handle empty materials correctly. This will need to be re-tested with COLLADA 1.3 materials.
[glaforte 17-04-06] Export and Documentation: Added Doxygen group for all the math classes. Re-organized the automated export/import test into multiple files and a namespace. Wrote an automated test for the export/import of lights. Fixed the case of the exported light type. Added un-implemented RemoveEntity function to the library. This function will require a lot of extra structure.
[glaforte 17-04-06] Documentation: Finished (finally), the documentation of the FCDCamera class. Corrected some doxygen warnings in the polygon set class and the document class.

Release 1.07
[glaforte 13-04-06] FCollada: Corrected a small application-compatibility issue found in ColladaMax.
[glaforte 13-04-06] FCollada: Added basic exception handling in non-debug builds and fixed XSI import of animation curve tangents [theirs are 2D points, we use the strange bezier derivate].
[   aazar 13-04-06] Fixed overwrite/clone bug in the FCDEffectParameterSurface. Everything works back correctly with shaders. Fixed reading of multiple <init_from> elements. Fixed reading of gravity and timestep in the Collada file. Added angular velocity to physics
[   zhang 13-04-06] Traverse the group node and looking for <bind_material> to import light link.
[   aazar 12-04-06] Fixed bug in file path reading for FCDEffectCode. This fixed the rendering for a few Cg datasets. Rewrote the FCDEffectParameterSurface class to support the 40,000 new initialization possibilities of a surface.
[   zhang 12-04-06] Modified FindNamedAnimated() with string operations.
[glaforte 11-04-06] Integration: Integrated the errors found within FCollada by Autodesk's recent changes to ColladaMax.
[glaforte 10-04-06] Export and Documentation: Continued writing a simple test scenario for a mesh export/import: added a list of static indices for the vertex positions and colors to export and verify on re-import. Added functions to the mesh polygon set interface to add and remove faces. Since holes and faces are listed together within the face-vertex degree list for a polygon set, added function to access the hole/face information using an iterative index for faces.
[glaforte 07-04-06] Export and Documentation: Wrote the export/re-import test for the geometry sources. Fixed a memory hog within the DAE import code. Added a new constructor and an equivalency function for the FloatList class, which is now a class rather than a typedef. Added push/pull function for polygon set inputs as well as some renaming.
[glaforte 07-04-06] Export and Documentation: Documented the FCDGeometryPolygons and FCDGeometryPolygonsInput classes. Removed the ‘sourceId?member from the polygon set input class, as it now contains a pointer to the data source. Improved the interface of the geometry polygon set class. Added FMFloat and FMInteger, in order to better classify the information previously contained within FUtils.h. FMath.h now includes all the mathematical classes below it, rather than have FUtils includes them.
[glaforte 06-04-06] Export and documentation: Started an export/re-import test for a geometry mesh.  Documented the FCDGeometryMesh class at the same time as I added the information pushing functions and improved on the interface of the class. Documented the FCDGeometrySource class. Created a new sub-class: FCDObjectWithId, so that non-entity objects which require a unique id have access to that functionality. Documented the FCDObject and FCDObjectWithId classes. Fixed the export of the geometry source.
[glaforte 06-04-06] Export and Documentation: Enabled and fixed the MSVC 64-bit warnings: many integer types went from uint32 to size_t, which is unsigned, or intptr_t, which is signed. LibXML required a lot of work, as there are many 8-bit string substractions to calculate sizes. Removed from LibXML the "trio" classes, which were unused.
[   aazar 06-04-06] Fixed bug in FCDEffectParameter concerning 1D, 3D and Cube samplers.

Release 1.06
[glaforte 05-04-06] Zapped a few Doxygen warnings.
[glaforte 05-04-06] Documented FUDateTime.h. Documented FUXmlWriter.h.
[glaforte 05-04-06] Removed the FPoint and FMatrix typedefs. Everyone should use FMVector3 and FMMatrix44 instead. Documented the FUStatus class and some of the FUtils.h macros. Added FUString.h which includes string-related macros/functions previously found in FUtils.h.
[glaforte 05-04-06] Work from two weeks ago: continued the documentation of the FCDCamera class.
[glaforte 04-04-06] Bug #38: Debug crash when importing. Reported by Alfred, this issue occurs only when importing a COLLADA document that has some visibility animation. This bug was due to leaking animation curves, when the animation curves for visibility were cloned in FCollada.
[   zhang 31-03-06] FCDEffectParameterBool returns boolean value

Added the CreateMesh and CreateSpline functions to the FCDGeometry class, in order to create a new mesh/spline for a new geometry object. Fixed the export of the camera, which was missing the <optics> element. Fixed the re-import of the entity notes: Refactored the extra structure containment. The FCDEntity base class now contains the extra structure. Documented and wrote an import/export test for the FCDGeometrySpline class. Implemented the export of splines. Improved the interface of the FCDGeometrySpline class so that retrieving information for splines is slightly less convoluted.
[   aazar 27-03-06] Fixed loading of physics scene since unique names have been implemented. We now load the rigid constraints and bodies correctly from sid instead of id, but looking them up in their physics model.
[glaforte 24-03-06] Added a test sequence for the export/import/push of camera information. Started documenting the FCDCamera class.
[glaforte 24-03-06] Completed the first draft Doxygeon documentation for the FCDocument class.

[   aazar 23-03-06] Adapted FCDImage to read in height, width and depth.
[glaforte 23-03-06] Started a full, simple, import-export scene test for visual scenes within FColladaTest. Wrote the push for libraries entities and the scene node transforms/children. Added the unique name map for the entities. Write out default names for all the entities, targeted or otherwise. Fixed a few export issues: empty names and the push of visual scene when there are no roots.
[glaforte 23-03-06] Implemented the export of the animation clips. Added accessors for the parent of an animation channel.
[   aazar 22-03-06] Fixed rigid constraint angular limit bug.
[   aazar 17-03-06] In FCDPhysicsRigidConstraint, added reading in of translation/rotation nodes inside rigid constraint attachment, and fixed a bug in reading interpenetrate node.
[glaforte 17-03-06] Added a flushing function to FULogFile.
[claforte 16-03-06] Fixed crash when exporting the default sphere in ColladaMaya: due to the string builder not being initialized properly.
[   aazar 16-03-06] Initialization and bug fix in FCDPhysicsRigidConstraint.
[glaforte 16-03-06] Animation clips don't have Ids when exported from ColladaMaya, right now so work-around them when importing in FCollada.
[claforte 15-03-06] Fixed import problems with files loaded from FX Composer 2, that have surfaces with no <init_from> image.

[glaforte 14-03-06] PS3: Fixed up the strlen within the string builder. Modified the absolute path creation with the FUFileManager.
[   aazar 13-03-06] Updated the LoadFromXML functions of the analytical geometries to take into account they have no Id. Added some Get functions to the FCDPhysicsRigidConstraint.
[claforte 13-03-06] Port to PS3: Fixed many warnings, e.g. missing newline at the end of include, enums were not using latest C++ spec, etc. Added #ifdefs related to PPU (PowerPC Unit), for stuff OpenGL ES-specific limitations, missing time() function, etc. Fixed bug in FindHierarchyChildBySid. Introduced some abstractions, e.g. fglActiveTexture and fglClientActiveTexture, to simplify support for OpenGL ES. Replaced Configure-generated makefile in PS3 DevIL by a hand-written one. Note that the ported version compiles and runs on the PS3, but nothing shows up due to #ifdef-ed code that needs to be written.
[glaforte 13-03-06] Added to FDCSkinController::ReduceInfluences a minimum weight threshold.
[   aazar 10-03-06] Mostly all physics-related: Completed the FCollada part for importing.

[  aleung 03-03-06] Wrote an initial doxygen script. Started documenting the FMath classes for Doxygen.
[glaforte 02-03-06] Planned the refactoring of the animation classes in order to support import/export/push/pull correctly. Added to the FCDAnimationCurve all the information necessary for it to do its own import/export. Similarly for FCDAnimationMultiCurve. When registering the animated values for export, just write out the targets to the curves. Implemented the recursive export of the animation trees.
[glaforte 02-03-06] Fixed memory overwrite within the FUStringBuilder template class.
[   zhang 28-02-06] Correct the float parameter min/max parsing.
[glaforte 27-02-06] Removed the Maya-Max type references from FCollada. Fixed the compilation errors in FUtils.
[glaforte 25-02-06] Added FUAssert and included Blinn shading on a few levels.
[glaforte 23-02-06] Fixed-up the STL #includes, in an attempt to fix the FCollada DLL.
[glaforte 23-02-06] 06-003-07: Fixed the loading of this skin test case, coming from COLLADA 1.3: the geometry cloning was not working when overriding the position-source.
[glaforte 23-02-06] ColladaMaya Fixes: Fixed the morph target input types. Fixed the array export types to be IDREF_arrays as well as their accessor parameter types to be IDREF. Fixed the import of the animation drivers: the input driver target processing was not correctly. 
[  aleung 22-02-06] Performance: performance boost by reserving all the memory at once for the tessellations.
[   aazar 21-02-06] Physics: Completed FCDPhysicsShape and FCDAnalyticalGeometry, added FCDPhysicsScene class separate from FCDScene. Fixed many parsing bugs (mostly related to the order of parsing and instantiation) and some crashes related to incomplete destructors. It is now possible to load physics scenes and the FCD classes will read in correctly all the physics information.
[   aazar 21-02-06] Physics: Created the FCDPhysicsRigidConstraintInstance class. Completed the LoadXML for the FCDPhysicsRigidConstraint class.
[glaforte 21-02-06] Importer: Fixed the scene node animation import sampling.
[   aazar 20-02-06] Physics: Added lots of stuff for 1.4 Physics support. Some nodes are not complete yet, so don't try importing physics datasets as it will probably crash. The main nodes that need more work are the FCDPhysicsShape and the FCDPhysicsAnalyticalGeometry (need to derive classes for sphere, box, capsule, etc).
[   aazar 20-02-06] Physics: The other change worth mentioning is a slight modification in the ToFloat functions of the FUStringConversion, to check for infinity. That's a sensitive function and if something goes wrong, the whole rendering gets screwed up.
[glaforte 19-02-06] Light/Camera Export: Added and implemented the WriteToXML for the FCDlight and FCDCamera classes, writing out all the different supported light/camera types and the extra parameters for both Max and Maya, with their animations.

Release 1.03
[glaforte 15-02-06] Fixed the matrix flattening of scene nodes.
[glaforte 15-02-06] Fixed the import of scene node's notes/user-properties.
[glaforte 14-02-06] Standard Material Export: Wrote the export of the standard material texture and its animated placement/projection parameters.
[glaforte 13-02-06] Standard Material Export: Implemented the export of the standard material’s parameters and texture lists. Split the export function into four functions that export either the textures belong to the correct texture channel(s) as a standard material parameter, or the <color>/<float> element with its animation, if there is one.
[glaforte 11-02-06] Controller Export: Added and implemented the WriteToXML to the FCDController, FCDMorphController and FCDSkinController classes. Added morph method string conversion. Implemented the export of IDRef arrays and sources. Corrected the missing id/name for the <geometry> element export. Corrected the extra ??in the morph target source. Corrected the ‘float?parameter type used too often in accessors.
[glaforte 10-02-06] Fixed the ordering of the cloning, so that the FCDEffectCode objects are always cloned before the passes.
[glaforte 09-02-06] Material Export: Split the FCDEffectPass class into itself and the FCDEffectPassShader class, which will hold all custom shader information, instead of assuming there are exactly one vertex and one fragment shader. Implemented the XML export of the FCDEffectPass and the FCDEffectPassShader classes. Created the FCDEffectCode class to hold both <include> and <code> ColladaFX element values. Corrected the <shader><name> element to read in the contents as the name and to use the ‘source?attribute for name-matching with the <include>/<code> elements.
[glaforte 08-02-06] Instantiation Export: Added the basic WriteToXML functionality to the effects/materials and the instances.
[glaforte 08-02-06] Fixed memory-related crash within the effect parameter release.
[  aleung 08-02-06] Fixed compilation error in FCDMorphController.
[glaforte 08-02-06] Instantiation Refactoring: Added the parsing of the ‘platform?attribute for ColladaFX profiles. Refactored the material instance class to hold the simple bind information as well. Added material ‘flattening?to the material instance class, so that viewers can assume only ColladaFX techniques hold parameters. The parameter values are trickled down by matching references. All the <newparam> parameters are trickled down, while the <setparam> parameters overwrite the <newparam> parameters below. Implemented the WriteToXML functions for the effect, the effect profile and the effect technique classes. Added the parsing of the <technique_hint> elements at the material level.
[glaforte 08-02-06] Instantiation Refactoring: Added FCDEffectParameterList class, based on the std:vector of parameters, adding a parameter lookup-by-name function. Refactored the FCDEffectParameter to not be tied to a ‘pass?object, as a parent. The parameters now use their own reference string for error-reporting. Added a parameter list at the material, effect, profile and technique levels. Refactored the ‘pass?to hold simple bind information, rather than all the parameters. 
[glaforte 08-02-06] Instantiation Refactoring: In order to support correctly the export of geometry/controller instances, some refactoring is necessary, with respect to material parameters and their binding. The plan is to move from flattening materials on import to flattening materials on-demand, keeping the parameter override information around so that it can be modified and exported correctly. 
[glaforte 07-02-06] Animation Export: Remove empty animation libraries.
[   aazar 07-02-06] Fixed a crash when releasing FCDocument, due to non-virtual destructors and missing memory deallocations.
[glaforte 07-02-06] Animation Export: Implemented XML export functions for the basic animation curve: splitting the export of the sources, samplers and channels, in order to keep the <animation> element enforced ordering. Wrote the XML export functions for the merged animation curve, with a custom stride and multiple accessor parameters. Implemented the export of animated translations and rotations. Tested with a simple, animated DAE file. Found/Investigated memory corruption crash: was due to wrong include being added to the tools?project. Corrected id-generation for the animation sources, the export of float arrays.
[glaforte 07-02-06] Animation Export: New feature: when generating a ‘sid? look for uniqueness, within the scope. Use an incremental counter appended to the wanted ‘sid?value, in order to generate unique sids. Fixed duplicated VERTEX geometry input, found within my current test case. Added the animation export to the other transformation elements.
[glaforte 06-02-06] Animation Export: Plan out the export of animation curves, animated values and animation clips, for FCollada. Implemented the cleaning-up of name and id string values, in order to strip them of the invalid characters, on export. Save the node for the animation library in the FCDocument object. Added a function to export the animated value, if it has curves attached to it. Added and Implemented WriteToXML function for the animated value: check for curve merging, and then export either the merged curve or the individual curves.
[glaforte 05-02-06] DLL Project: Some refactoring related to the usage of int8. Added functions to FUFileManager for relative/absolute/url filenames.
[glaforte 05-02-06] Material Export: The material library now exports effects for ColladaFX profiles and the standard profile, as well as materials with instantiated effects. The image library now exports file images correctly.
[claforte 03-02-06] Modified definitions used in ColladaMaya physics export: <limits> instead of <limit>, <ref_attachment>.
[glaforte 03-02-06] Geometry Export/Refactoring: Added WriteToXML functions at the relevant levels. Split the FCDGeometry class into the spline and mesh components. This modifies the API for the FCollada: merge in the changes within the viewer. 
[glaforte 03-02-06] Import/Export of Asset tag: Added FCDAsset and FCDAssetContributor elements. Added FUDateTime class and its string parsing mechanism: mostly for the UTC times in the asset tags.

Release 1.02
[glaforte 02-02-06] Some corrections of warnings/errors for MacOSX and GCC.
[glaforte 01-02-06] Refactored the FUStringConversion header to have more inlined functions and reverted the changes on the ToFloat, ToUInt and ToInt functions to use our own parsing functions, as they were much faster than fstrtoX.
[glaforte 31-01-06] FCollada Extra Tree: Added and Implemented FCDExtra, FCDETechnique and FCDENode classes. Added an FCDExtra object to the scene node.
[glaforte 31-01-06] FCollada Extra Tree and Animations: Added FCDAnimatedCustom class that contains animation curves of any sizes and their float* targets directly. Refactored the animation system to link animations right away, resulting in a much smaller FCDAnimated object count. FCDENode contains an FCDAnimatedCustom object. Modified the scene node object to parse and extra the Max and Maya-specific parameters and their animations directly from the extra tree.
[   aazar 31-01-06] Created FCDEffectTechnique class to support multiple techniques in ColladaFX. FCDEffectProfile now has a list of FCDEffectTechnique, which has a list of FCDEffectPass, which has a list of FCDEffectParameters.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Added to FCDocument the export functions: WriteToFile and WriteDocumentToXML(). I'll be propagating these over the other FCDx classes.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Added writing utility namespaces: FUXmlWriter and FUDaeWriter. Ported ColladaMaya's XML writing functions over to the FUXmlWriter, but FUDaeWriter is still empty.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Added to FCDLibrary, FCDEntity and FCDSceneNode some basic writing functionality.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Made all the write to XML functions const.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Added ToString functions for FPoint and FMatrix, with length conversion.
[glaforte 30-01-06] Added to FCDTransform and its derivates, XML writing functions.

Release 1.01
[glaforte 30-01-06] First official version: includes all the modifications to the FS import classes made for the different projects,
[glaforte 30-01-06] up to now. Added DLL support and unicode support to the project(s).
