Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks - Installation Guide
		    Version 2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction
------------

This document explains how to install and configure Intel(R) Threading
Building Blocks.  Installation is a multi-step process.  You should read
this document in its entirety before you begin.  Follow the steps
provided in sequence.


Installing Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks
---------------------------------------------

The installation software installs the full set of Intel(R) Threading
Building Blocks files for your platform, for all supported operating
systems and processors.

Previous versions of Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks can co-exist
with this version.  However, if you are installing an update on a system
that has another release of *this version* installed, then during 
the installation you will be asked to uninstall the existing release 
before installing the update, except if you use non-RPM installation
on Linux* systems.

The default install location on Microsoft* Windows* systems is:

    C:\Program Files\Intel\TBB\<version>
            or
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\TBB\<version>
        (64-bit versions of Microsoft* Windows* only)

The default install location on Linux* systems is:

    /opt/intel/tbb/<version>
            or
    <home_dir>/intel/tbb/<version>
        (If you are not logged in as root)

The default install location on Mac OS* X systems is:

    /Library/Frameworks/TBB.framework/Versions/<version>

To install on Microsoft* Windows* systems:

    1.  Start the installation program.

	a.  If you received the product on CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM
	    into a CD-ROM drive.  If the installation program does not
	    automatically start, locate the file Setup.exe on the CD-ROM
	    and double-click it.

	b.  If you received the product as an electronic download,
	    double-click the downloaded file, named
	    tbb<version>_<package#>_win.exe.

	The installation program starts.  Click "Next".

    2.  At the prompt, accept the default temporary directory or choose
	a different temporary directory into which the contents of the
	self-extracting installation file will be placed before actual
	installation begins.  Click "Next".

    3.  The Intel(R) Software Setup Assistant appears.  Click "Next" to
	continue the installation, or click the links provided on the
	left-hand side to view useful product and support information.

    4.  Choose between the following product license options:

	    (1) Use the existing license found on the system.
	    (2) Provide your serial number.
	    (3) Provide a license file.

	A recommended option is indicated, and options that are not
	applicable are not displayed.

	a.  Choose option (1) and click "Next" if an existing license is
	    already available on your system.

	b.  Choose option (2), enter a serial number, and click "Next"
	    if you are connected to the Internet and you have a serial
	    number.

	    A serial number was provided to you when you purchased the
	    product, either in an e-mail from Intel or your reseller, or
	    on a sticker attached to the CD-ROM package.  The correct
	    license, based on the serial number, will automatically be
	    downloaded and installed on your system.

	c.  Choose option (3), enter the path to a license file, and
	    click "Next" if you have a license file provided to you 
	    after registration of your serial number.

    5.  Select Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks in "Tool Selection" 
	dialog, and click "Next".

    6.  The installation begins.  Click "Next" to proceed.

    7.  Read the license agreement and decide if you accept it or not.
	If you accept the agreement, click "Next" to proceed.  If you 
	choose not to accept it, click "Cancel" to stop the installation.

    8.  Accept the default installation directory or choose a different
	directory.  All product files are installed in the directory you 
	choose.  Any previous product version(s) can co-exist with this 
	product version if installed in different directories.  
	Make sure to update your build scripts to point to the desired 
	product version if you choose to keep multiple versions 
	installed.  Click "Next".

    9.  Select the checkbox to register the PATH, LIB and INCLUDE
	environment variables for the environment you wish to use, so
	that the product libraries and headers can be located easily
	when compiling and linking.  Click "Install" to proceed with the
	installation.

	After the installation completes, a file named tbbvars.bat is
	placed in each of the "bin" sub-directories where the product
	software is installed.  Use this file to set the PATH, LIB and
	INCLUDE environment variables in a user shell or to select a
	different environment after installing.

    9.  Wait for the installation to complete, and then click "Finish".

    10. If you have not already registered your product, a registration
	screen appears.  Enter your full e-mail address to register for
	support, free product updates, and more, or click "Cancel" to
	skip the registration step.

	If you have already registered your product, the Intel(R)
	Software Setup Assistant re-appears.  Click the links on the
	left-hand side, or click "Finish" when done.

To install on Linux* systems:

    In the following instructions, specific examples of commands for
    various steps are prefixed with '#' characters.

    1.  Unpack the package in a directory to which you have write
	access.

	    # cd <directory>
	    # tar -xzf tbb<version>_<package#>_lin.tgz

	directory where the package was unpacked in the previous step.

	    # cd <directory>/tbb<version>_<package#>_lin
	    # ./install.sh

    3.  If you are logged in as root, the installation will proceed 
	automatically; otherwise you will be asked to choose whether 
	you want to run installation under root account (root password 
	required) or as current user. When running under root account,
	the installation will automatically use RPM if available on your
	system. When not under root account, you may only install 
	without using RPM.

    4.  The Intel(R) Software Setup Assistant starts.  The installation
	script displays a series of options:

	    1.  Install
	    2.  Readme
	    3.  Release Notes
	    ...
	    etc.

	Enter 1 to begin the installation, or enter another choice to
	view useful product and support information.

	    a license file provided to you after registration of your 
	    serial number.

    6.  Enter 1 to proceed with the installation, or enter x to exit
	without installing.

    7.  Press <enter> to display the license agreement.  Read the
	license agreement and enter "accept" to continue or "reject" to 
	exit.

    8.  The installation will continue after accepting the license
	agreement.

	Enter the desired install path or press <enter> to accept
	the default install path.  All the product files are installed 
	in the directory you choose.  Any previous product version(s) can 
	remain installed if this product version is installed into 
	a separate directory.  Make sure to update your build scripts 
	to point to the desired product version if you choose to keep 
	multiple versions installed.

	In each case you need to choose directories for which you have 
	write access.

    9.  Wait for the installation to complete.

	After the installation completes:

	- The "bin" and "lib" sub-directories are created that contain 
	    links to the architecture/platform-specific "bin" and "lib"
	    sub-directories for the architecture and platform on which
	    the product software was installed.

	- Files named tbbvars.sh and tbbvars.csh are placed in the
	    "bin" sub-directories.  Use these files with appropriate
	    arguments, or directly use files from "bin/{architecture}" 
	    sub-directories to set the LIBRARY_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, 
	    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and CPATH environment variables in a user 
	    shell so that the product libraries and headers can be
	    located when compiling and linking.

    10. If you have not already registered your product, a registration
	screen appears.  Enter your full e-mail address to register for
	support, free product updates, and more, or enter x to skip the
	registration step and exit the installation script.

Known Issues
------------

Please note the following with respect to this particular release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks.

Windows* Installation Issues

    - If the version of Windows* Installer on your system is older
	than version 2.0, the installer will automatically upgrade it
	and you will need to reboot the computer after the installation
	is complete.

    - Scripts are used in the normal install process and may trip
	false positives in certain antivirus software.  You may need to
	disable script blocking or you may be able to temporarily allow
	scripts for the installation process.

    - When using a non-English log-in name on a Windows* system, the
	Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks installer may fail.  The
	workaround is to change to an English log-in name.  If you have
	already started the installation and encounter this issue, use
	Task Manager and click "End Task" for each of these processes:
	setup.exe, secore.exe, and sewingui.exe.

Linux* Installation Issues

    - Some versions of RPM do not allow installation to a non-default
	installation directory, including RPM 4.0.2 (resolved in RPM
	4.0.3) and RPM 4.1 (resolved in RPM 4.11 to 4.2).

    - When installing on Linux*, there is a known issue where the
	registration step at the end of the installation program may
	freeze after your e-mail address is entered.  If this occurs,
	you may interrupt the installation program (e.g., via pressing
	<ctrl-C>); the installation should already have completed.
	In this case, you may register via the Intel(R) Software
	Development Products Registration Center by visiting:

		https://registrationcenter.intel.com/

Mac OS* X Installation Issues

    - Xcode* tool suite 2.4.1 or higher must be installed prior to
	installing Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks on Mac OS* X
	systems.
