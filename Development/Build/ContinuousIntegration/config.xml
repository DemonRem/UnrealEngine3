Because the pauses are only as large as the
 interval to check the schedule, only one build will fire during the time 
 the builds are unpaused.  So technically,
 the pause builders do my time schedule for me and using the multiple 
 builds makes sure that
 the build runs and avoids problems with syncing up the pauses and time 
 schedule wierdnesses.
 However, it doesn"t allow the rebuild to happen if failure occurs until 
 the next unpaused time.

<!-- Do a daily build at 1300 -->
